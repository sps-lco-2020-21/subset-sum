# subset-sum

**Input:** take a list of positive integers S (note it is a list, not a set, i.e. duplicates are allowed) and an integer p > 0.

**Output:** a list of integers that is a subset of S whose elements sum to p. Return null if no such subset can be identified.

**Example:** `S = {3,10, 5, 17, 8, 7, 4, 4}`, `p = 21`. 

The result could be `{3, 10, 8}`. There might be many answers, you just need to return one. `{4, 4, 10, 3}` is allowed, because `4` is duplicated in the input, `{8, 8, 5}` is not allowed because `8` was not duplicated in the input.

- don't google for answers. Use you brain.
- collaborate on algorithms and data structures, but write your own code
- when successful: can you analyse the space and time complexity of your approach?
